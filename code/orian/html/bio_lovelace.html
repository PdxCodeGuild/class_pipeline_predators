    <h1 class="title">Ada lovelace Bio</h1>
    <h2> Pioneer of Computing</h2>
    <p>Ada Lovelace was born in 1815 from her famous poet father Lord Byron and mother Annabella (lady Byron). Shortly
        after her birth Lord Byron separated from the family and left England for good and gave away legal rights to his
        daughter. He died in Greece when Ada was just 8 years old. Ada's mother was a mathematician and push her to
        learn mathematics as a child to avoid being like her father the "poet" who Lady Byron claimed was a deviant.
        Although Lovelace’s mother pushes her into the field, she would become famous for she was not close to her
        mother and spent most of her time living with her maternal grandmother Judith, Hon. Lady Milbanke, who was known
        to dote on her granddaughter. Because of the Lovelace’s position in England’s high society, she had access to
        some of the great scientists and authors of England including Charles Dickenson and Charles Babbage who she
        would go on to work with later in life. Lovelace translated the Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea's article
        on Babbage's newest proposed machine, the Analytical Engine. The Analytic Engine was considered by some to be
        the first design of a computer although it was never built or tested. Ada Lovelace took a job in 1842 that would
        take her almost a year to complete which would push her into the history books and because of her in-depth
        knowledge of mathematics and her detailed notes that where beyond Menabrea’s writings Ada Lovelace is known as
        being the first computer programmer in the world. Lovelace would go on the other feats in mathematics, but that
        translation and adaptation would be the work she was most well know for. Ada Lovelace died at the age of 36 in
        1852 of cancer of the uterus. Her contributions as a programmer where later disputed by some biographers of
        Charles Babbage, but most agree she was the only person to see value and applications of the invention of the
        analytical engine and without her influence the idea may have delayed computing progress. </p>

    <h2>Quotes by Ada Lovelace</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><q>The more I study, the more insatiable do I feel my genius for it to be. </q></li>
        <li><q>The science of operations, as derived from mathematics more especially, is a science of itself, and has
                its
                own abstract truth and value.</q></li>
