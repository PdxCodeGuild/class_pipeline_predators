Visit https://openweathermap.org/price and choose two options within the Free Plan
Build a program that asks the user for a city, and prints out the result. Itâ€™s up to you how to build this. 
You can create a loop that asks the user for the current weather, or for a 7 days daily forecast, you can print out the wind speed, convert UTC timestamps in your own local time, etc.
Remember to add a .gitignore file to hide the API key before pushing everything to GitHub!
