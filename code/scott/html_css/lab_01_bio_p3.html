    <h1>Pablo Picasso</h1>

    Pablo Ruiz Picasso[a][b] (25 October 1881 to 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker,
    ceramicist and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France. Regarded as one of
    the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement,
    the invention of constructed sculpture,[8][9] the co-invention of collage, and for the wide
    variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist
    Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), and Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica
    by German and Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War.</p>
